abstract: "This paper presents our efforts to implement, acquire similar 
           results and improve the ones achieved by the authors of the original 
           article. We follow the steps and models described in their article and 
           the same public data sets of EEG Signals. Epilepsy affects more than 65 
           million people globally, and EEG Signals are critical to analyze and 
           recognize epilepsy. Although the efforts in the last years, it is still 
           challenging to extract useful information from these signals and select 
           useful features from numerous them in a diagnostic application. We 
           construct a deep convolution network and autoencoders-based model (AE-
           CDNN) in order to perform unsupervised feature learning. We use the AE-
           CDNN to extract the features of the available data sets, and then we 
           use some common classifiers to classify the features. The results 
           obtained demonstrate that the proposed AE-CDNN to perform the 
           traditional feature extraction based classification techniques by 
           achieving better accuracy of classification."
