### Abstract


This paper presents our efforts to reproduce and improve the results achieved by the authors of the original article. We follow the steps and models described in their article and the same public data sets of EEG Signals. Epilepsy affects more than 65 million people globally, and EEG Signals are critical to analyze and recognize epilepsy. Although the efforts in the last years, it is still challenging to extract useful information from these signals and select useful features in a diagnostic application. We construct a deep convolution network and autoencoders-based model (AE-CDNN) in order to perform unsupervised feature learning. We use the AE-CDNN to extract the features of the available data sets, and then we use some common classifiers to classify the features. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed AE-CDNN outperforms the traditional feature extraction based classification techniques by achieving better accuracy of classification.


## Prerequisites for Reprodubility

Clone the repository and the branch:

```shell
!git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 -b Aristimunha-Alves-Pinaya-Camargo --single-branch https://github.com/bruAristimunha/ReScience-submission.git 
```

Install Conda, we recommend the [tutorial](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

Create a conda enviromnment as follows:

```shell
conda create --name eeg python=3.7 pip --yes
conda activate eeg
```
We recommend using a GPU, if you have it available. But if not, just ignore the first line below:

```shell
conda install -c anaconda tensorflow-gpu 
pip install -r ReScience-submission/requirements.txt
```

### Execute

We recommend using the [notebook](https://github.com/bruAristimunha/ReScience-submission/blob/Aristimunha-Alves-Pinaya-Camargo/notebook/Jupyter_Paper_Re_Deep_Convolution_Neural_Network_and_Autoencoders_Based_Unsupervised_Feature_Learning_of_EEG_Signals.ipynb) or the colab to reproduce the results.
